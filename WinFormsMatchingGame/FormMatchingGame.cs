// TODO:
// Add image descriptions.
// Check exe runs in isolation.
// Code cleanup.
// Create ReadMe file, with prerequisites of .NET 5.

// DataGridViewButtonCell doesn't seem to support an image on the button.
// (Painting the image in CellPainting doesn't seem a very clean way to go.)
// So use DataGridViewButtonCell, and explicitly check for a Space key press.
// Then again, DataGridViewImageCell doesn't support a click, and didn't seem 
// to support being clicked via Windows Speech Recognition, so stick with a
// DataGridViewButtonCell.
